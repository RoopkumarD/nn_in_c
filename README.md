# Neural Networks in C

This repository documents my journey of learning C by implementing neural networks from
scratch. I'll be sharing my progress, ideas, and experiments in overoptimizing neural
networks using C.

## Current Progress

I'm currently improving my shallow neural network implementation in `shallow_nn.c`. Once
I've refined this, I'll move on to exploring other neural network architectures.

## Matrix Library

I've implemented a custom matrix library in `mat.c`, which uses a linear continuous array
to store matrix data. I'm using arithmetic operations to determine the index.

## Getting Started

To use the code, simply execute `build.sh` to generate the `shallow_nn.out` executable.

## Implementation History

If you're interested in seeing how my implementation has evolved, check out the following
tags:

* **v0.1.0**: Multi-pointer array implementation for matrices
* **v0.2.0**: Linear array implementation for matrices

## Contributing

I appreciate any contributions to improve the code! If you have suggestions or
improvements, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request.
